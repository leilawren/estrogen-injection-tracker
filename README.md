# estrogen-injection-tracker
A couple short, slapped-together scripts that let me keep track of my injection cycle.

# Dependencies

KDE Plasma "command-output" widget or some other widget like eww maybe.

# How to use it

Copy estro-cycle.sh and estro-cycle-reset.sh scripts to your /usr/bin/ directory

Use "command output" widget configuration to run esto-cycle.sh periodically. Set "on-click" behavior to run estro-cycle-reset.sh to reset the tracker.

Click widget to reset on injection day.

# What's next? 

I want to make my own widget and and popup config / reset UI.
